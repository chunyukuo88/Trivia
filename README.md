Trivia and more!
This repo contains the trivia app as well as the list of questions (a class without a main method) that are referenced by the trivia app.
They must be saved to the save module to be used. (Or was it folder? Or package?) Still working on the nomenclature here...

But it definitely works. And in the spirit of video game dev heritage, I have added easter eggs and cheat codes. 

Enjoy!
